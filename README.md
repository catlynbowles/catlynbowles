<h2> âš¡ About Me âš¡ </h2>

- Nice to meet you ! I'm Catlyn, a massage therapist turned software engineer. Becoming a developer has made me a more creative, dynamic and adaptable problem solver and person. Something that excites me about his field is the influence and power web applications have on daily life, and in my dream career I'd be developing tools that positively impact populations affected by inequality. In my previous career, I worked primarily with cancer patients who inspired me to live life to the fullest, and to embrace every new experience! I'm incredibly thankful for that and bring that energy into this new life, where I'm learning to whip up web apps with React, JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Cypress, Mocha, Chai and more: TBD ! I would love to connect with you, whoever you are. So please feel free to reach out with any random thoughts, cat pictures, or anything else inbetween. <br><br>
